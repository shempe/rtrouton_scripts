# This mini shell script will read your logs, output the information to a text file, 
# and then mail the output to an email address. 
# This originally was in an AFP548.com server setup guide, which you can download
# from http://www.afp548.com/filemgmt/visit.php?lid=68 (written by Corey Carson).
# I've taken the script and edited it, smartening it up to make it portable.
# Basically, it reads your logs, outputs it to a file, and shoots the file over to you via email.
# Use at your own risk; there are no guarantees with this script.

# Modified by Rich Trouton - rtrouton@mail.nih.gov; January 14th 2008
# Following sections added to original script: "CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED SSH AND CONSOLE CONNECTIONS",  "AFP STATUS", "SMB STATUS",
# "ATTEMPTED UNAUTHORIZED SUDO USE", "AUTHORIZED SUDO USE"
# Sections modified from original script: "UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO LOGIN VIA SSH"
# Sections removed from original script (don't use Tivoli or rsync for backups): "TSM DAILY BACKUP TRANSFER", "RSYNC TRIGGER FILE"

# Modified by Rich Trouton - richtrouton@mac.com; April 28, 2011
# Sections modified from previous script: "TIME MACHINE ACTIVITY"
# Added system.log checking for both the 10.5 and 10.6 backupd processes
# For 10.5, it checks for /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd
# For 10.6, it checks for com.apple.backupd
#
# Modified by Rich Trouton - richtrouton@mac.com; April 29, 2011
# Following sections added to original script: CHECK APPLE RAID
# Added checking for G5s and Intel Macs that may have hardware RAID cards
# installed. If the G5 or Intel Mac has a RAID card installed, the status is
# reported. Otherwise returns that there's no hardware RAID card installed. If
# Mac is not a G5 or an Intel Mac, section will add nothing to the email report
#
# Modified by Rich Trouton - richtrouton@mac.com; January 26, 2013
# 
# Updated the following variables to support 10.8 Server:
# 
# Added /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/sbin
# to the PATH export as serveradmin has moved to 
# /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/sbin/serveradmin
#
# /var/log/secure.log's functions have been moved to Apple System Log.
# Now running syslog -k Time ge -24h | grep 'sshd' to have syslog check
# ASL for SSH errors in the last 24 hours. Output is exported to 
# /private/tmp/ssh-status.txt, then ssh-status.txt is scraped for SSH errors.
