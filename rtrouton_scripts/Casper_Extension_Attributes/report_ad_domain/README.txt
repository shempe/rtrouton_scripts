This Casper Extension Attribute checks to see if the Mac is connected to an Active Directory domain.   If the Mac is not bound to LDAP, script returns "Not Bound to Active Directory". If bound to Active Directory, the AD domain name is returned.

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
