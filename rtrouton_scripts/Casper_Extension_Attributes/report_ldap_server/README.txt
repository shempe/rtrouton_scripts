This Casper Extension Attribute checks to see if the Mac is connected to an LDAP server.   If the Mac is not bound to LDAP, script returns "Not Bound to LDAP". If bound to LDAP, the address of the LDAP server is returned.

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
