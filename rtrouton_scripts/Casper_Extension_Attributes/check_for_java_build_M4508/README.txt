This Casper Extension Attribute determines if either of the the following Java builds are installed: 

10.6.x: 1.6.0_51-b11-456-10M4508
10.7.x - 10.8.x: 1.6.0_51-b11-456-11M4508 

These builds were installed by the first versions of Java for OS X 2013-004 and Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 16 and can cause problems for Java Swing applications like MATLAB and Papercut.

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
