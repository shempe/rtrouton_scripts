This Casper Extension Attribute which checks if the CasperCheck LaunchDaemon and script are installed. 

If both the script and LaunchDaemon are available at the defined location, script returns "Yes". If either or both are missing, the script returns "No"

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
