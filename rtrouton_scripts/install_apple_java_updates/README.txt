This script provides a way to install Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 17 on 10.6.x Macs using Apple's command-line softwareupdate tool. The script does the following:

1. Verify again that the Mac has Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 17 as an available update.
2. If Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 17 is not an available update, the script logs that information then exits silently.
3. If Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 17 is an available update, the script logs that the update is being installed. Apple's softwareupdate tool then installs that update silently in the background.
