I've adapted this script to take care of uninstalling FileWave agents on OS X. It should stop running FileWave clients and clean up all application, settings and receipts files.

Note: My shop does not use FileWave, so this script is untested. If you give this a try and it works correctly, please drop me a line at rtrouton (at) gmail.com
